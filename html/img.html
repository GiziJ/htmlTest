        <p>In combination with -lo it may be translated as "dickwad",
             "dickhead" or "prick". The words are identical in Russian, 
             Ukrainian, and Belarusian. In May 2014, 
             media outlets reported that the Russian profanity khuilo 
             had been added to the Urban Dictionary as a synonym for 
             Vladimir Putin.</p>
